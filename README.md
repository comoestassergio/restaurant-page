# Rice&Fish

It's a restaurant from my hometown. Their business is quite **small** and **lacking a website**.

So I figured **I could make one** as one of my projects. 

The page is an SPA with all its content rendered into one page. 
I made the rendering look and feel as close to rendering components in React as I could.

No frameworks are used here.
